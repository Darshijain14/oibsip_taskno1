# Iris Flower Classification
The Iris flower dataset includes measurements of three different Iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each species can be distinguished based on specific floral characteristics.

### Project Overview
Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project! This repository explores machine learning concepts through one of the most well-known datasets in the field. By analyzing measurements from Iris flowers, we aim to build a model that can accurately classify each sample into its respective species.

### Objective
Given a dataset containing flower measurements labeled by species, the goal is to train a machine learning model that can effectively learn from the data and classify new Iris samples. This project highlights the practical application of supervised learning and classification techniques in solving real-world problems.

### Key Features
